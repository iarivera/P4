            <p>Insomnia is the first studio album by Johnny Manchild & The Poor Bastards released in 2018. Leaning into a more 
                rock oriented sound with some tracks, while maintaining the more jazzy feel the band had previously used in their 
                EP, Valencia. Across twelve tracks, Insomnia dives into themes of existentialism, while Johnny sings about the thoughts, 
                feelings and memories that keep him up at night.</p>
            <p>Each song has a distinct sound that makes it seem as if you're listening to one of the many subgenres of rock, a 
                different genre altogether, or even a blend of multiple genres. The tracks that lean more towards a rock oriented 
                sound, often use guitar, drums, and keys as the melodic lines, while other instruments take lead in tracks that 
                aren't rock oriented.</p>
            <p>Standout tracks include, Sleep, Lightning, Deserve, Gestapo, and Insomnia. Sleep opens the album, with an almost 
                minute long intro of a clock ticking along with other ambience that one would hear in the dead of night. It serves 
                as Johnny's desperate cry to sleep, he sings about holding regrets, with the instrumentation helping to set an anxious 
                feeling that comes with not being able to sleep because of particular thoughts. Lighting, my personal favorite track on 
                the album, is a beautiful ballad addressed to a friend of Johnny's. He tells her that he'll always be there for her 
                if she needs it, as she decided to leave everything behind to pursue her dreams of being a musician. A long instrumental 
                break closes the track that contains a sax solo, followed by a repeating of the opening melody. Deserve is another beautiful 
                song that has a brighter melody, while questioning whether or not he deserves what bad things happen to him. The penultimate 
                track, Gestapo stands out as the black sheep of the album in that, thematically, it doesn't fit in with the themes every 
                tracking preceding it covers. Despite that, it is an energetic song that serves as a fuck you to the man who destroyed the 
                one piece of trivia Grover Cleveland was known for. The final track, the title track, lyrically contains a hopeful outlook 
                that all the obstacles mentioned in previous songs will be overcome. This is further reinforced by the instrumentation being 
                hopeful and gentle, with a musical build up towards the end. The theme comes full circle once the instruments finish, the 
                ticking clock that opened the album is once again heard, signaling the passage of time late at night.</p>
            <p>Johnny Manchild & The Poor Bastards delivered an great album from start to finish, that is able to make shifts in genres, 
                and is very much worth the listen.</p>
