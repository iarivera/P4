        <h2>Looking Back on Look Back</h2>
        <img src="../images/dummy" alt="Key visual of Look Back">
        <div class="article">
            <p>Look Back was finally released in North American theaters back in October. Directed by 
                Kiyotaka Oshiyama, this adaptation of Tatsuki Fujimoto's manga oneshot of the same name 
                was something I didn't know I needed, but appreciated deeply once I saw it. </p>
            <p>The story focuses on two 4th grade girls, Fujino and Kyomoto. Fujino is a girl who draws 
                4 panel manga for her school paper, which is well received by her classmates. It isn't 
                until Fujino's teacher asks her to let Kyomoto, a student who doesn't attend classes, 
                publish a manga in the paper. Upon Fujino seeing Kyomoto's work, she instantly views 
                Kyomoto as a rival and is determined to become a better artist than her. They finally 
                meet, at the end of their time in primary school, when Fujino is asked to deliver Kyomoto's 
                diploma. Upon meeting, Fujino learns that Kyomoto never viewed her as a rival, but in fact 
                idolized her. It was at this moment that a friendship blossomed between the two artists.</p>
            <p>I would dive more into what happened, but that would mean making the emotions that follow 
                later on in the film be less impactful. One thing I appreciate about Look Back is the amount 
                of care that went into making sure that the source material was translated well into an animated 
                format. Capturing the expressiveness that Fujino had in the manga, and the way the two protagonists 
                moved. The soundtrack, composed by haruka nakumura, managed to match the current emotion it was 
                playing alongside. The music, in my opinion, was the second most important element of this movie 
                behind animation because of how there isn't much dialogue in Look Back. Watching Look Back reminded 
                me how beautiful art is, creating art is worth it, and in an age where generative AI is attempting to 
                make a foothold in art, and the human element in art is what makes it special. Currently Look Back can 
                be streamed on Amazon Prime, and can be viewed with its original japanese cast, or an english cast 
                (this statement isn't an ad, I really want people to watch Look Back).</p>
